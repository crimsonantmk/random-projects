        <h1>Introduction to the Kenyan Government</h1>

        <h2>Introduction to the National Government and Political Systems</h2>
        <p>Kenya’s national government operates under a democratic system, which allows citizens to participate in the political process through elections and civic engagement. The political system in Kenya is structured to ensure that power is distributed across various branches, with each branch having its own defined roles and responsibilities. Below are some key terms to understand the political landscape:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Democracy</strong>: A system of government where power is vested in the people, allowing them to elect representatives and make decisions that influence the country's direction. Kenya operates as a representative democracy.</li>
            <li><strong>Election</strong>: The process by which citizens choose their leaders, including the President, Members of Parliament, and County Representatives. Elections in Kenya are held every five years, giving citizens a voice in their government.</li>
            <li><strong>Governance</strong>: The methods and processes through which the government makes decisions, implements policies, and ensures accountability. Good governance emphasizes transparency, rule of law, and effective service delivery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overview of the Government Structure</h2>
        <p>Kenya's government is a unitary republic, governed under a multi-party system. The political system is based on the Constitution of Kenya, which was ratified in 2010. The government is divided into three main branches: the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary, each functioning independently while maintaining checks and balances on the others.</p>

        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>Kenya's history is rich and diverse, from its early days as a British colony to gaining independence on December 12, 1963. After independence, Jomo Kenyatta became the first President of Kenya. Kenya has since grown into a republic with significant economic and political milestones, including the formation of devolved county governments under the 2010 Constitution, giving citizens greater control over local governance.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts About Kenya</h2>
