        <h1>Government Structure of Kenya</h1>

        <h2>The Three Branches of Government</h2>
        <p>Kenya’s government is divided into three branches: the Executive, the Legislature, and the Judiciary. Each branch has unique roles and responsibilities to ensure a balanced and accountable government.</p>

        <!-- Executive Branch Section -->
        <h2>Executive Branch</h2>
        <p>The Executive branch is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws. It is headed by the President, who is the Head of State, Head of Government, and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The President is elected by Kenyan citizens and serves a five-year term, with a maximum of two terms. The Executive also includes the Deputy President, Cabinet Secretaries, and other appointed officials who assist in running various government ministries.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Legislative Branch Section -->
        <h2>Legislative Branch</h2>
        <p>The Legislature, also known as Parliament, is responsible for making laws. It is bicameral, consisting of two houses: the National Assembly and the Senate. Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected to represent different constituencies and counties. The National Assembly handles matters related to national governance, while the Senate represents the counties and oversees devolution. Parliament also plays a crucial role in approving budgets, scrutinizing government activities, and providing checks and balances on the Executive.</p>

        </div>

        <!-- Judicial Branch Section -->
        <h2>Judicial Branch</h2>
        <p>The Judiciary is responsible for interpreting the law and administering justice. It operates independently of the other branches and is led by the Chief Justice, who is appointed by the President. The judiciary includes various courts, such as the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, and other lower courts. Judges ensure that justice is upheld and that citizens’ rights are protected under the law. The judiciary also reviews laws and government actions to ensure they are in line with the Constitution.</p>
