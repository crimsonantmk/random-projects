    <h1>Political Parties in Kenya</h1>
    <p>
      Political parties play a crucial role in the democratic process of Kenya. They serve as platforms for citizens to organize, advocate for their interests, and participate in the governance of the country. These parties influence government policies and shape the trajectory of the nation's development.
    </p>

    <h2>The Role of Political Parties in Kenya</h2>
    <p>
      In Kenya, political parties are responsible for nominating candidates for various elected positions, including the presidency, members of parliament, and county-level offices. They also play a significant role in shaping the policy agenda and promoting their ideological positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Political parties in Kenya have a long and complex history, with some tracing their roots back to the independence movement. These parties have evolved over time, reflecting the changing political landscape and the diverse interests of the Kenyan people.
    </p>

    <h2>Major Political Parties in Kenya</h2>
    <p>
      Kenya has a multi-party system, with several major political parties currently active. Here's a brief overview of some of the key players:
    </p>

    <h3>Jubilee Party</h3>
    <p>
      The Jubilee Party was formed in 2016 through a merger of several smaller parties. It is currently the ruling party in Kenya, with President William Ruto as its leader. The party's key successes include the implementation of infrastructure projects and initiatives to improve healthcare and education.
    </p>

    <h3>Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)</h3>
    <p>
      The ODM party was founded in 2005 and is one of the largest opposition parties in Kenya. It was instrumental in the 2002 election that ended decades of single-party rule. The party's focus has been on addressing issues of economic inequality, corruption, and political reforms.
    </p>

    <h3>Democratic Party (DP)</h3>
    <p>
      The DP was founded in 1991 and played a significant role in Kenya's transition to multi-party democracy. The party has advocated for decentralization of power, improved transparency, and pro-business policies.
    </p>

    <h3>Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM)</h3>
    <p>
      The WDM was established in 2013 and is led by Kalonzo Musyoka. The party has a strong presence in the coastal and eastern regions of Kenya and has championed issues related to devolution and regional development.
