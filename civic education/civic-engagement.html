    <h1>Civic Engagement in Kenya</h1>
    <p>
      Civic engagement is the cornerstone of a thriving democracy. By actively participating in the political and social processes, citizens can make a meaningful impact on their communities and the country as a whole. In this section, we'll explore various ways you can get involved and make your voice heard.
    </p>

    <h2>Voting</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most fundamental ways to engage in the democratic process is by voting. By casting your ballot, you can directly influence the leaders and policies that shape the future of Kenya. Remember, every vote counts, so make sure to register and participate in all elections, from national to local.
    </p>

    <h2>Volunteering</h2>
    <p>
      Volunteering is another powerful way to get involved in your community. You can volunteer with local organizations, non-profits, or even directly with your elected representatives to support causes you care about, such as education, healthcare, or environmental protection.
    </p>

    <h2>Contacting Representatives</h2>
    <p>
      Don't be afraid to reach out to your elected representatives, whether at the national, county, or local level. Sharing your concerns, ideas, and feedback can help shape the policies and decisions that impact your community. Remember, your voice matters, so make sure it's heard.
    </p>

    <h2>Real-World Examples</h2>
    <p>
